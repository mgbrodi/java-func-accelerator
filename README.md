# New Java Function Accelerator

Use this accelerator for a quick access to a workload implemented through a java funtion  that comes configured in two flavors:

- for a local cluster directly in k8s leveraging quick loop with build through pack and direct deployment on changes.
- for a shared Tap-enabled cluster directly on cnr using Tanzu Build Service, Live Updates, Live View and pipelines orchestration through Choreographer.
